# Weather App

This is a simple iOS app built using SwiftUI that fetches and displays the current weather for a city using the OpenWeather API. The app allows the user to input a city name and displays the city's name, temperature, and weather description.

## Features

- User can enter a city name to get the weather information.
- Displays the current temperature and weather description for the selected city.
- Background image and cloud shape behind the weather details.
- "Refresh" button to load the data from the API.

## Technologies Used

- SwiftUI
- URLSession
- Codable Protocol
- OpenWeather API

## Troubleshooting
Ensure you have a working internet connection since the app fetches data from an external API.
Double-check your OpenWeather API key is correctly
If you encounter issues with the app not displaying the weather, make sure the city name is correct and try again.
